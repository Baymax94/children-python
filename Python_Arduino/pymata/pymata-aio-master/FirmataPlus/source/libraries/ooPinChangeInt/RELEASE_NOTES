	ooPinChangeInt Release Notes

	This is the ooPinChangeInt library for the Arduino.
	See google code project for latest bugs and info http://code.google.com/p/arduino-oopinchangeint/

	This library provides an extension to the interrupt support for arduino by adding pin change
	interrupts, giving a way for users to have interrupts drive off of any pin (ATmega328-based
	Arduinos) and by the Port B, J, and K pins on the Arduino Mega and its ilk.

	Library is derived from and begins with the PinChangeInt v 1.3 code.  See http://code.google.com/p/arduino-pinchangeint/

---- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS --------------------------------------------------------------------
	This library was originally written by Chris J. Klick, Robot builder and all around geek, who said of it,
		"HI, Yeah, I wrote the original PCint library. It was a bit of a hack and the new one has better
		features.  I intended the code to be freely usable.  Didn't really think about a license.  Feel
		free to use it in your code: I hereby grant you permission."
	Thanks, Chris! A hack? I dare say not, if I have taken this any further it's merely by standing on the
	shoulders of giants. This library was the best "tutorial" I found on Arduino Pin Change Interrupts
	and because of that I decided to continue to maintain and (hopefully) improve it. We, the Arduino
	community of robot builders and geeks, owe you a great debt of gratitude for your hack- a hack in
	the finest sense.

	The library was then picked up by Lex Talionis, who created the Google Code website. We all owe a debt
	of thanks to Lex, too, for all his hard work! He is currently the other official maintainer of this
	code.

	Chris' original PCInt Arduino Playground example is here: http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/PcInt

	Many thanks to all the contributors who have contributed bug fixes, code, and suggestions
	to this project: 
	John Boiles and Baziki (who added fixes to PcInt), Maurice Beelen, nms277, Akesson Karlpetter, and
	Orly Andico for various fixes to this code, Rob Tillaart for some excellent code reviews and nice
	optimizations, Andre' Franken for a good bug report that kept me thinking, cserveny.tamas a special
	shout out for providing the MEGA code to PinChangeInt- Thanks!

	Regarding the MEGA and friends, Cserveny says: "J is mostly useless, because of the hardware UART. I was
	not able to get pin change notifications from the TX pin (14), so only 15 left. All other pins are not
	connected on the arduino boards."

---- VERSIONS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.03(beta) Wed Nov 21 18:20:46 CST 2012
Added MEGA support, as per PinChangeInt. This support has not been tested in this library; if you do use it with the MEGA please let me know. See the Google Code site for more information. Thanks.

Modified to not delete() pins that get detachInterrupt()'ed. Now when you detachInterrupt(), the PORT just disables interrupts for that pin; the PCintPin object remains in memory and in the linked list of pins (possibly slowing down your interrupts a couple of micros).  You can reenable a detached interrupt- but you must do it within the PinChangeInt library (would anyone ever enable an interrupt on a pin, then disable it, then have need to reenable it but not using the library?).

Made the interrupt handler faster with an optimization from robtillaart to take out the checks for changed pins from the while() loop that steps through the pins:
uint8_t changedPins = (PCintPort::curr ^ lastPinView) &
                      ((portRisingPins & PCintPort::curr ) | ( portFallingPins & ~PCintPort::curr ));

...This speedup is offset by changes in the PCint() handler, especially the PCintPort::curr bug reported below. This change was brought over from the Version 2.13(beta) PinChangeInt code.

Other bugfixes that follow the PinChangeInt-2.17beta release:

1. PCintPort::curr bug. In the interrupt handler PCint(), we loop as long as PCIFR indicates a new interrupt wants to be triggered, provided DISABLE_PCINT_MULTI_SERVICE is not defined (it is not by default):
#ifndef DISABLE_PCINT_MULTI_SERVICE
        pcifr = PCIFR & PCICRbit;
        PCIFR = pcifr;  // clear the interrupt if we will process it (no effect if bit is zero)
} while(pcifr);
#endif
...Well. Problem is, if a pin pops up and causes the PCIFR to change, we have to reread the port and look at how it is now! I wasn't doing that before, so if a new interrupt appeared while I was still servicing the old one, odd behavior would take place. For example, an interrupt would register but then the userFunc would not be called upon to service it.
2. attachInterrupt() now returns a uint8_t value:  1 on successful attach, 0 on successful attach but using an already-enabled pin, and -1 if the new() operator failed to create a PCintPin object.
3. Created the enable() method, so that in the next interation I will be able to perform the optimization from robtillaart to take out the checks for the changed pins in the while() loop in PCint(). Look for a description of this change in the next beta version.

	Version 1.00 Sat Dec  3 22:56:20 CST 2011
	Modified to use the new() operator and symbolic links instead of creating a pre-populated
	array of pointers to the pins.  This consumes more flash, but makes possible some
	additional C++ style functionality later.

	Version 1.01 Thu Dec  8 21:29:11 CST 2011
	Modified to use a C++ callback function.  The arduinoPin variable is no longer necessary,
	as this creates a new methodology for using the library.

	Version 1.02 Tue Mon Mar  5 18:37:28 CST 2012
	All code moved into this .h file so as to make it possible to recognize #define's in the
	user's sketch.

	Added #ifdef LIBCALL_OOPINCHANGEINT.  Programmers using this library in another library
	should define this macro, because this will allow you to #include it in your sketch AND
	#include it in the library.
    (As a matter of act, you must always #include this file in your sketch, even if it's only
	used to support another library.  See the Tigger library and example, for an example.)

	Code uses the cbiface library, which is a much simplified and renamed version of cb.h
